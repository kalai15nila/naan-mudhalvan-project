# Garage Management System on Salesforce

A comprehensive Garage Management System (GMS) built on Salesforce, designed to help garage owners manage vehicles, services, customer relationships, invoicing, and reporting, all while leveraging the power of Salesforce CRM.

## Features

- **Vehicle Management**: Manage vehicles and associated service records with custom Salesforce objects like `Vehicle`, `Repair_Service`, and `Customer`.
- **Customer Relationship Management**: Use Salesforceâ€™s standard objects (`Account`, `Contact`) for managing customer data and interaction history.
- **Service Tracking**: Log and track service requests, repairs, and maintenance jobs. Services can be linked to vehicles and customer accounts.
- **Invoice Generation**: Automatically generate invoices upon service completion, using Salesforce's automation tools like Process Builder or Flow.
- **Reports and Dashboards**: Leverage Salesforce's powerful reporting and dashboard tools to track vehicle statuses, service histories, and financial data.
- **Email Notifications & Alerts**: Set up custom email templates and notification alerts to keep customers updated on service progress or reminders for upcoming appointments.
- **Custom Automation**: Use Salesforce Flow or Apex to automate processes like service scheduling, billing, and notifications.
- **Integration with Third-Party Systems**: Integrate with external systems such as payment gateways or inventory management systems using Salesforce APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **Salesforce Objects**: Custom objects for vehicle management, service tracking, and invoicing.
- **Apex**: Custom backend logic for advanced functionality and integrations.
- **Salesforce Flow**: For process automation like service reminders, scheduling, and invoicing.
- **Reports & Dashboards**: Built-in Salesforce tools for data analysis and reporting.
- **REST API**: To integrate with external systems like payment processors or service providers.
- **Lightning Web Components (LWC)**: Custom UI components for a more user-friendly experience.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A Salesforce Developer Edition or Sandbox environment.
- Administrative access to Salesforce to create and deploy custom objects and automation.
- Basic knowledge of Salesforce Apex, Flow, and Lightning Web Components (LWC).

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/garage-management-salesforce.git
cd garage-management-salesforce
```

### Setting Up the Salesforce Org

1. **Create Custom Objects**: 
   - Create custom objects like `Vehicle`, `Repair_Service`, and `Invoice` in Salesforce. You can do this using Salesforce Setup or by importing metadata files.
   - Link objects together using relationships (e.g., `Vehicle` to `Repair_Service` and `Repair_Service` to `Account`).
  
2. **Deploy Lightning Components**:
   - For any custom Lightning Web Components (LWC), deploy them to your Salesforce environment.
   - Use Salesforce CLI or Salesforce Setup to add components to your Salesforce Org.

3. **Configure Process Automation**:
   - Set up Flows, Process Builder processes, and Apex triggers for automating service records, invoice creation, and email notifications.
  
4. **Install Packages**:
   - If using external integrations, install third-party packages or configure custom REST API connections.

### Running the Application

1. After deploying the custom objects, components, and automation, log into your Salesforce org.
2. Open the "App Launcher" and search for your Garage Management System app.
3. Use the system to add vehicles, log services, generate invoices, and track customer data.

## Usage

- **Add a Vehicle**: Create a new `Vehicle` record with relevant details like make, model, and VIN.
- **Log a Service**: Use the `Repair_Service` object to record repairs or services performed on a vehicle.
- **Generate an Invoice**: Once a service is completed, create an invoice linked to the customer and service details.
- **Create Reports**: Use Salesforce's report builder to create custom reports on vehicle service history, invoices, and customer interaction data.
- **Send Email Notifications**: Automate customer notifications through email templates or Salesforce Flow.

### Additional Tips for Salesforce Development:

- **Metadata Deployment**: If using Salesforce DX for development, you may want to deploy metadata such as custom objects, Apex classes, and Lightning components using the Salesforce CLI.
- **Integration Considerations**: If your Garage Management System integrates with external systems, consider using **Salesforce Connect**, **Named Credentials**, or **Platform Events** for efficient data sync.

This README is designed to help other developers or administrators understand how to deploy and customize the Salesforce solution, making it easy to get started with the Garage Management System in Salesforce.
